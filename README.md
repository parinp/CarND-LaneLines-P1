Overview
---


In this particular we were given the task to correctly identify lane lines on roads.  To achieve this, we had to rely on a number of packages but mainly **OpenCV** in order to detect these lane lines.

For this project, I have modified the code to fulfill all the requirements required as given in the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/322/view).

**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. First, I converted the images to grayscale, then I .... 

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by ...

If you'd like to include images to show how the pipeline works, here is how to include an image:

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline


One potential shortcoming would be what would happen when ... 

Another shortcoming could be ...


### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline
